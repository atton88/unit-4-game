Logic for game to run
```
// On key press, starts function
document.onkeyup = function (event) {
    var userKey = event.key.toLowerCase();

    // Checks to see if key press is a letter, if so start the play function; else, do nothing.
    for (i = 0; i < alphabet.length; i++) {
        if (userKey === alphabet[i]) {

            //check for duplicate letters
            if (!keyGuessed.includes(userKey)) {
                play(userKey, randKey); //run game
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Game function
```
// play function, starts game
function play(userKey, mewKey) {

    console.log("user: " + userKey + " mew: " + mewKey); //test
    keyGuessed.push(userKey);

    // you win, reset game
    if (mewKey === userKey) {
        wins++;
        reset();
        alert("You win!"); //test
    }

    // No guesses left, you lose, reset game
else if (guesses != 1) {
        console.log("Choose another letter");
        // change text of guesses and keys pressed
        guesses--;
        guessesText.textContent = guesses;
        keyText.textContent = keyGuessed;
    }

    // guess again
    else {
        losses++;
        reset();
        alert("You lost"); //test
    }
}
```
